## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shahriar-008/Market-Alert-Extension.git
cd price-alert-extension
```

### 2. Get an Alpha Vantage API Key

1. Visit [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) and sign up for a free API key.
2. Open `background.js` and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key:

   ```javascript
   const ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = "your-api-key";
   ```

### 3. Load the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle switch in the top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the repository folder.

## Usage

### Open the Extension

- Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the popup with two tabs: **Alerts** and **History**.

### Set a New Alert

1. **Alerts Tab:**
   - Enter a symbol (e.g., `AAPL` for stocks, `EUR/USD` for forex).
   - Set the target price.
   - Click **"Set Alert"**.

2. **View Alert History:**
   - Switch to the **History** tab to view triggered alerts.

### Notification & Sound

- You will receive a desktop notification and hear a sound when the target price is reached.

## Customization

### Frequency of Price Checks

- The extension checks prices every 30 seconds. Modify in `background.js`:

  ```javascript
  chrome.alarms.create("priceCheck", { periodInMinutes: 0.5 });
  ```

### Alert Sound

- Replace `alert.mp3` with your preferred sound file. Ensure the file is updated in the manifest and offscreen HTML.

### UI Adjustments

- Customize the look and feel by editing `popup.html` and `popup.css`.

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound When Popup is Closed?

- Check the console (`chrome://extensions/` > Inspect service worker) for errors related to offscreen document creation.

### API Issues?

- Verify your API key in `background.js`.
- Free API keys have usage limits (typically 5 requests per minute).

### Alerts Not Triggering?

- Ensure correct symbol format: `AAPL` for stocks, `EUR/USD` for forex.
